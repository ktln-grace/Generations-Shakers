        <h2 class="sub-heading">Hollow-Blocks Campaign</h2>
        <p class="post-text">In the heart of every believer lies a desire to honor God and His kingdom. From the humblest of beginnings to the grandest of visions, the act of building has always held a special significance in the story of God's people. In the Bible, we see this theme echoed time and time again – from the construction of Noah's ark to the building of the temple by King Solomon.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Inspired by the biblical example of King Solomon, whose wisdom and dedication led to the construction of the magnificent temple in Jerusalem, our church has embarked on its own building project – Project Solomon. This endeavor seeks to create a space where believers can gather, worship, and grow in their faith together.</p>
        <p class="post-text">But as any builder knows, constructing something of lasting significance requires more than just vision and ambition – it requires resources, support, and collaboration. That's where the Hollow Blocks Campaign comes in.</p>
        <p class="post-text">The concept is simple yet powerful: for every donation of 25 pesos, equivalent to the cost of one hollow block, individuals can contribute to the construction of our church building. There is no limit to how many blocks one can donate – whether it's one block or a hundred, every contribution makes a difference.</p>
        <p class="post-text">Now, you might be wondering, why hollow blocks? Beyond their practical function in construction, hollow blocks serve as a tangible symbol of unity and solidarity. Each block represents a small but essential part of the larger whole – much like how every member of the body of Christ plays a vital role in building up the church (1 Corinthians 12:12-27)</p>
        <p class="post-text">Moreover, the act of giving is deeply rooted in biblical principles. In the book of Exodus, we see the Israelites coming together to contribute materials for the construction of the tabernacle, demonstrating their willingness to give generously from what they had (Exodus 35:4-29). Similarly, the apostle Paul encourages believers to give cheerfully, knowing that their generosity will result in thanksgiving to God and meet the needs of others (2 Corinthians 9:6-15).</p>
        <p class="post-text">So, will you join us in building together? Your donation – whether big or small – will not only contribute to the physical construction of our church building but also to the spiritual growth and fellowship of all who gather within its walls. Together, let's honor God's kingdom and leave a legacy that will endure for generations to come.</p>
